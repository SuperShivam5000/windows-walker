## 🚀 Windows Walker – What Copilot for Windows should have been.

When Microsoft Copilot first arrived, it hinted at a future where you could control your system with natural language. That functionality was quickly dropped and I was disappointed — so I built **Windows Walker** to bring it back.

Windows Walker is your personal AI-powered Windows assistant. Give it simple voice or text commands, and it translates them into real system actions using PowerShell under the hood.

🧠 Powered by Gemini + PowerShell, and wrapped in a clean Electron UI, it acts just like a human assistant would.

💬 Try telling it things like:          
"Open notepad"           
"Open chrome and go to chatgpt.com"         
"Turn on bluetooth"         
"Turn on dark mode"        
...and it just does it. No scripting, no right-clicks, no settings-hunting.        

🖥️ Tech Stack: Node.js, Express.js, Electron.js, PowerShell, Google Generative AI
